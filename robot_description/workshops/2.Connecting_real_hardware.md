# CONNECTING REAL HARDWARE

You have created a new moveit config package for the custom UR5 URDF and used the `demo.launch.py` to get a quick feel for how it works with RVIZ. This method is useful for quickly verifying the setup assistant process and the validity of the URDF. Unfortunately, what it executes is just fake controllers for this reason. Further configuration is necessary to fully connect Moveit and the real controllers. This tutorial will show you how to do this for the ur_robot_driver.   

---

## 1. Creating the real hardware launchfile for ur5e_robot_cell

The ur_robot_driver package provides us with a highly configurable launch file to connect to the real robot hardware. We are now going to create a launchfile for our application, that uses launchfiles provided by ur_robot_driver and by moveit setup assistant to launch our robot cell.

1. Create a file called ``robot.launch.py`` in the ``ur5e_cell_moveit_config/launch`` folder.

2. The first step is to import the dependencies we need for this launch file. We are going to use standard items from the launch and launch_ros library. Furthermore, we are using som functions from moveit_configs_utils and launch_ros_extras packages (see below).

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import DeclareLaunchArgument, IncludeLaunchDescription
from launch.conditions import IfCondition
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration, PathJoinSubstitution

from launch_ros.substitutions import FindPackageShare

from launch_ros_extras.actions import LoadMoveitConfig, GenerateMoveitLaunch

from moveit_configs_utils.launch_utils import DeclareBooleanLaunchArg

from moveit_configs_utils.launches import (
    generate_move_group_launch,
    generate_moveit_rviz_launch,
)

```

3. Every launch file has ``generate_launch_description`` function, which returns the ``LaunchDescription``with all entities we want to launch.

```python
def generate_launch_description() -> LaunchDescription:
```

4. Add the launch arguments we need as input from the user (e.g. the IP of the robot).

```python
    database_config = DeclareBooleanLaunchArg(
            "db",
            default_value=False,
            description="By default, we do not start a database (it can be large)",
            )


    debug_config = DeclareBooleanLaunchArg(
            "debug",
            default_value=False,
            description="By default, we are not in debug mode",
        )
    
    rviz_config = DeclareBooleanLaunchArg(
            "use_rviz", 
            default_value=True,
            description="Whether to use RVIZ or not."    
        )
    
    robot_ip_config = DeclareLaunchArgument(
            name="robot_ip",
            default_value="192.168.56.2",
            description="The IP address of the robot to connect to."
        )
```

5. Now we want to load the moveit configuration and launch the move_group node (the main node of moveit) as well as the rviz (if the user wants rviz to be launched). To do this we use the ``launch_ros_extras`` package and functions provided by the ``moveit_configs_utils`` package.

```python
    load_moveit_config = LoadMoveitConfig(
        robot_name="ur5e_workcell_fake",
        package_name="ur5e_cell_moveit_config")
    
    generate_move_group_ld = GenerateMoveitLaunch(
        function=generate_move_group_launch
    )
    
    generate_moveit_rviz_ld = GenerateMoveitLaunch(
        function=generate_moveit_rviz_launch,
        condition=IfCondition(LaunchConfiguration("use_rviz"))
    )
```

6. Then it is time to include the ``ur_control.launch.py`` launch file provided by the ``ur_robot_driver`` package, which contains everything that is necessary to connect to the real hardware. We use the launch arguments to configure the driver for our purpose.

```python
    ur_control_launch = IncludeLaunchDescription(
        launch_description_source=PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(
            PathJoinSubstitution([FindPackageShare("ur_robot_driver"), "launch", "ur_control.launch.py"])
        ),
        launch_arguments={
            "ur_type": "ur5e",              
            "use_fake_hardware": "false",
            "initial_joint_controller": "joint_trajectory_controller",
            "activate_joint_controller": "true",
            "robot_ip": LaunchConfiguration("robot_ip"),
            "description_package": "ur5e_cell_description",
            "description_file": "workcell.urdf.xacro",
            "launch_rviz": "false"
            }.items()
    )
```

7. Finally, we need to add all launch entities we created to the ``LaunchDescription`` and return it. When adding the entities it is important to use the right order. We need to first launch the arguments, then load the configuration, launch the hardware and finally launch move_group and rviz.

```python
    ld = LaunchDescription(
        [
            database_config,
            debug_config,
            rviz_config,
            robot_ip_config,
            load_moveit_config,
            ur_control_launch,
            generate_move_group_ld,
            generate_moveit_rviz_ld,
        ]
    )
    return ld
```

Now the launchfile is complete and you can rebuild your workspace by using the following command.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select ur5e_cell_moveit_config
```

## 3. Introspection

Launch the RQT Graph tool again to observe what the computation graph looks like now.   

If you had saved the previous graph, you would notice that the `/robot_state_publisher` came previously from a `/move_group/fake_controller_joint_states` node whereas now it comes from Gazebo/real robot, telling us that the actual robot is being tracked.   

You will also notice a new `/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory` action, which now drives the sim/actual robot.   

When you execute a valid plan, echo in terminal the topics in this action, specifically the *goal*, *status* and *result* topics, to see what is being published. The goal shows you what the computed trajectory precisely looks like. This one set of values is the result of the complete Moveit pipeline.
