# MOVEIT
## The motion planning framework

---

## MoveIt Capabilities  

- Motion Planning  
    - Generate high-degree of freedom trajectories through  
      cluttered environments and avoid local minima  
- Manipulation  
    - Analyze and interact with the environment with grasp generation  
- Inverse Kinematics  
    - Solve for joint positions for a given pose, even in over-actuated arms  
- Control  
    - Execute time-parameterized joint trajectories to low level hardware  
controllers through common interfaces  
- 3D Perception  
    - Connect to depth sensors and point clouds with Octomaps  
- Collision Checking  
    - Avoid obstacles using geometric primitives, meshes, or point clouds

## Robot Model

- `RobotModel` class contains the relationships between all links and joints including their joint limit properties as loaded from the `URDF`.   
- It also separates the robot's links and joints into planning groups defined in the `SRDF` (`JointModelGroup`).

</div>

---

## Robot State

- `RobotState` contains information about the robot at a certain point in time, storing vectors of joint positions and optionally velocities and accelerations. 
- `RobotState` can include any objects attached to (carried by) the robot
- It also contains helper functions for setting the Cartesian pose and for computing Cartesian trajectories

</div>

---

## Planning Scene
- `PlanningScene` is an object used for storing the representation of the world around the robot and also the state of the robot itself 
- It provides the main interface used for collision checking and constraint checking
- `PlanningSceneMonitor` is the recommended method to create and maintain the current planning scene using data from the robot's joints and the sensors on the robot

</div>

---

## Planning Scene Monitor

The `PlanningSceneMonitor` wraps a `PlanningScene` with ROS interfaces for keeping the planning scene up-to-date

</div>

---

## Planning Pipeline

- `PlanningPipeline` is used to chain motion planner with pre-processing and post-processing planned path (e.g. time parameterization)
- `PlanningPipeline` uses ROS parameters to determine set of request adapters and planning plugin
- Multiple motion planning algorithms can be used in a pipeline to produce robust motion plans

## Trajectory Execution Manager

- Library for managing controllers and the execution of trajectories
- Multiple trajectories can be specified to be executed in sequence
- The execution process:
    - Sends trajectories to appropriate controllers
    - Monitors execution
    - (optionally) waits for completion of the execution
    - Switches active controllers as needed (optionally) to be able to execute the specified trajectories
---

## MoveGroup

- `MoveGroupInterface` class provides easy to use functionality for 
    - setting joint or pose goals
    - creating motion plans
    - moving the robot
    - adding objects into the environment
    - attaching/detaching objects from the robot 
- It communicates over ROS topics, services, and actions

---

## MoveItCpp

- `MoveItCpp` is a new high level interface without ROS interfaces
- Direct access to core MoveIt functionalities useful for realtime control or for industry applications

## PlanningComponent

---

## Constrain planning

---

## Cartesian planning

- end effector follows an exact path along a surface (welding and painting applications)
- list of waypoints specified for the end-effector to go through
- MoveIt! now supports real-time & global, collision-aware cartesian planning

#### Desirable properties
- Completeness, Underconstrained, Planning ahead, Realtime
